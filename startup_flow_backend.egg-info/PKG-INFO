# 🧠 Project: FounderOs – AI Startup Validation Platform

## 📘 Overview

**FounderOs** is an AI-driven platform that helps founders validate startup ideas from concept to funding readiness.  
The system breaks down validation into **structured stages**, where each stage processes user input and generates a **beautifully formatted HTML report**.

Unlike a chat interface, FounderOs uses a **guided, step-based UI** that ensures clarity, structure, and actionable feedback.

Each stage is powered by **AI agents** working behind the scenes — analyzing, researching, evaluating, and synthesizing outputs.

---

## 🎯 Core Objective

To provide an **interactive AI workspace** for startup validation by:
1. Allowing users to input startup ideas in structured stages.
2. Running AI-powered validation pipelines (through agents).
3. Displaying the results in HTML format — ready to view, save, or download.
4. Eventually expanding to a conversational (ChatGPT-style) mode in Phase 2.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

### 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **AI Core:** OpenAI GPT-4/5 or Anthropic Claude via LangChain or custom orchestrator
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Prisma or SQLAlchemy)
- **Hosting:** Dockerized microservices on DigitalOcean, AWS, or Vercel

## 🧭 Backend Overview (FastAPI)

The backend serves as the **central orchestrator** for all AI operations and validation flows.  
It manages agent pipelines, user requests, and generates the final HTML output.

### Responsibilities
- Handle stage-specific API endpoints (idea, market, competitors, etc.)
- Orchestrate agent chains for reasoning and research
- Manage AI context memory
- Return structured HTML responses to the frontend

### Example Endpoints
- `POST /validate/idea` → triggers AI agents for idea validation
- `POST /validate/problem-fit`
- `POST /validate/market`
- `POST /validate/mvp`
- `POST /validate/funding`
- `GET /report/:session_id` → returns combined HTML report

Each route corresponds to a **validation stage** and invokes a chain of AI agents.

---

## 🤖 Agent System (Backend AI Logic)

Each validation stage is powered by a set of **autonomous but cooperative AI agents**.  
They communicate through a shared orchestrator that coordinates task execution and passes results between them.

### Example Agent Chain (for Problem & Solution Fit)

1. **IdeaParserAgent**
   - Extracts key details from the user’s description.
   - Output example:
     ```json
     {
       "problem": "hard to find trusted artisans",
       "solution": "platform to match verified artisans"
     }
     ```

2. **ResearchAgent**
   - Searches for market data, competitor trends, and demand metrics.
   - Output example:
     ```json
     {
       "competitors": ["Thumbtack", "TaskRabbit"],
       "market_demand": "rising interest in local service platforms"
     }
     ```

3. **EvaluatorAgent**
   - Analyzes the combined data and gives a feasibility score, insights, and advice.
   - Produces raw markdown or structured JSON ready for formatting.

4. **FormatterAgent**
   - Converts final data into a styled HTML block.
   - Ensures consistency in layout and color scheme.
